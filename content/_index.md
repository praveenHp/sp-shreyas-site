Namaste!

I am Shreyas S P. With a foundation in policy analysis and governance, I am passionate about driving meaningful change through research-backed public policies. My experience preparing for the civil services exam has equipped me with a deep understanding of governance, public administration, and socio-economic issues.

I have gained hands-on experience through internships, where I worked on election research and data analysis. Additionally, my active presence on social media allows me to analyze and communicate political, social, and historical issues to a broader audience.

Currently, I am exploring opportunities to contribute to policy-making and governance, focusing on impactful projects in elections, governance, health and economic development. I am particularly interested in public policy roles that involve research, legislative work, and program implementation.

Beyond my professional interests, I engage in Vipassana meditation, strength training, and running, which help me maintain discipline and resilience.
