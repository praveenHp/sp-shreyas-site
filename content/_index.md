Hello, 

I’m Shreyas. 

I’m an engineer by degree and a public policy explorer by conviction. After
years of dedicated civil services preparation, I decided to pivot towards policy analysis and
political research.

During my civil services preparation, I delved into various subjects, including Indian and world
history, polity, economy, international affairs, geography, environment, science and technology,
and day-to-day current affairs.

In the midst of my preparation, I interned with teams that worked on electoral research, data
analysis, and citizen-centric policy design. I had the privilege of working at the Centre for Public
Policy Research in Kochi, where I analysed the election results of Haryana, Telangana, and
Madhya Pradesh. Additionally, I conducted research on the pre-election trends in Tamil Nadu
during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

To gain a deeper understanding of policy making, I completed a course titled ‘Graduate
Certificate in Public Policy’ at Takshashila Institute in Bangalore.

Alongside my academic and professional journey, I’ve actively shared commentary on political
and social issues through Instagram and Facebook, helping demystify governance for everyday
citizens.

In my personal life, I’m a practitioner of **Vipassana meditation**, a student of **India’s political
history**, and an advocate for **physical and mental discipline** through strength training, running,
and meditation.

I personally believe in Gandhian philosophy of truth-seeking, decentralisation, and village
governance; Nehruvian philosophy of secularism and democratic governance; and Ambedkarite
philosophy of social democracy and women empowerment.

Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded changemakers, contribute to
meaningful conversations, and remain committed to serving the public interest with clarity,
compassion, and courage.
