Hello, I’m Shreyas. I’m an engineer by degree and a public policy explorer by conviction. After
years of dedicated civil services preparation, I decided to pivot towards policy analysis and
political research.

During my civil services preparation, I delved into various subjects, including Indian and world
history, polity, economy, international affairs, geography, environment, science and technology,
and day-to-day current affairs.

In the midst of my preparation, I interned with teams that worked on electoral research, data
analysis, and citizen-centric policy design. I had the privilege of working at the Centre for Public
Policy Research in Kochi, where I analysed the election results of Haryana, Telangana, and
Madhya Pradesh. Additionally, I conducted research on the pre-election trends in Tamil Nadu
during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

To gain a deeper understanding of policy making, I completed a course titled ‘Graduate
Certificate in Public Policy’ at Takshashila Institute in Bangalore.

In my personal life, I’m a practitioner of **Vipassana meditation**, a student of **India’s political
history**, and an advocate for **physical and mental discipline** through strength training, running,
and meditation.

I personally believe in Gandhian philosophy of truth-seeking, decentralisation, and village
governance; Nehruvian philosophy of secularism and democratic governance; and Ambedkarite
philosophy of social democracy and women empowerment.

Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded changemakers, contribute to
meaningful conversations, and remain committed to serving the public interest with clarity,
compassion, and courage.
