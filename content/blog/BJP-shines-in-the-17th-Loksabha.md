A magnificent performance by BJP and a disastrous show by Congress! BJP's election-winning machinery is something which requires case studies. Though I'm a vocal critic of BJP's style of politics and their method of winning elections, at the end of the day, what matters is victory. Jo jeeta, wahi sikander!

Despite a dismal performance in agriculture, economy, employment creation, and unprecedented blunders like demonetisation, the BJP managed to win more seats than in 2014. It shows how elections can be won on emotions rather than real issues. The The Pulwama attack followed by the Balakot air strike just a few weeks before elections seems to have washed off the anti-incumbency factor against the Modi government. Added to it was the electronic media, controlled by the BJP favouring industrialists, giving maximum coverage to Modi. The use of the Army, religion, and communal hatred blatantly in election discourse was unchecked by the Election Commission, barring a few bans. The fact that a terror-accused candidate, Pragya Thakur, can win against former CM Digvijaya Singh and a great education reformer like Atishi can lose an election speaks volumes about the choices people make.

On the other side, the Congress party, which represented the soul of this country for a long time, has remained as vulnerable as in 2014. The Congress should undergo a revolution in its party structure and leadership to even be considered an alternative to the BJP. The Congress campaign in this election was impressive, but they have really lost the art of connecting with the masses and winning elections.

Considering Modi's past five-year record, I don't have any positive opinion about him. There is a high probability of him turning into a more aggressive, vindictive, and divisive person. Such a transformation would be a threat to the institutions and the soul of this country. I hope good judgment prevails over him in the next five years.
