The Bengal rape horror is not just violence against a doctor. It is violence against a woman. A woman is subject to violence irrespective of her status and profession.

Some of the fundamental reasons why I think there is violence against women:
1.	Patriarchal mindset of society. Since childhood, a boy and a girl are made to think one is superior to the other.
2.	Most of the major religions of the world (which were largely created by men) give lower status to women in rituals, rites, and religious practices. Religion is stringent towards women.
3.	Television and social media influence.
4.	Objectification of women and violence against women in mainstream movies and in pornography. Influenced by such content, men who lack the ability to regulate themselves indulge in harmful behaviours.
5.	Sexual frustration and high libido, which is aggravated by social media and porn addiction.
6.	Insensitive politicians and celebrities who make derogatory remarks against women.

The current outrage is justified. However, the solution should not be confined to it. The solution to such incidents lies within ourselves. We have to sensitise ourselves and the people around us. Those who are adamant to budge need to be dealt with assertively. Serial offenders and abusers should be obligated to fall in line either through societal norms or legal measures.

We should stop normalising indecent and vulgar comments against women in private conversations. As Gandhi said, we should be the change that we want to see in the world.
