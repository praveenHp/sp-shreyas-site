The dastardly attack on the CRPF convoy in Pulwama, that took away the lives of 44 CRPF jawans, is very disturbing news. It is difficult to imagine what their families might be going through! But do we have a roadmap for the future course of action?

I can see that the media fraternity is seeking another surgical strike. But the question is whether the surgical strike of 2016 helped us to prevent yesterday’s attack? The answer is ‘No’. The solution is attacking the root cause of the problem. 

It is very clear that the attack was conducted by the Pak-supported terror outfit JeM headed by Masood Azhar, who was released by the Indian government in 1999 during the Kandahar plane hijack. JeM has replaced LeT as a major terror outfit to conduct terror attacks on India.

Despite having all this information, none of the Indian governments after PVN Rao were able to capture Masood Azhar or Hafiz Saeed through international diplomacy. Addressing the root of the problem will have a long-term impact on India’s security, rather than short-term measures to convince people. The tragedy is that Indian security policies are getting highly politicized and the leaders are using it for political advantage. It is high time that Indian security policies and diplomacy are more focused on addressing the root cause of the problem.
