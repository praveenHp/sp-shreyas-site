+++

Since the 19th century, Congress has been an integral part of Indian consciousness. It led the initial resistance against British rule, gave birth to mass movements, emerged towering national leaders, propagated truth and non-violence, achieved freedom, healed the wounds of partition, promoted unity in diversity, and governed the country despite a poverty rate of 70% and a literacy rate of 12%. 

Despite these challenges, Congress achieved the highest GDP, lifted millions out of poverty, and set up important institutions like IITs, IIMs, and AIIMS. It also spearheaded the agricultural revolution, Bangladeshâ€™s liberation, and implemented a protectionist economic policy before transitioning to economic liberalisation, globalisation, and the IT revolution. The history of India since the late 19th century is deeply intertwined with the legacy of Congress.
