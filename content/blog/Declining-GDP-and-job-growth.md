title = 'Declining GDP and job growth'
+++

BJP inherited a recovering economy, which was growing upwards at 6.9% in 2013-14 (based on the new GDP calculation method). The current growth rate is 6.7% (2017-18), which is lower than what they inherited. They promised to create one crore jobs each year. The government has stopped releasing official job numbers as job growth is negative. Instead of creating jobs, the government has destroyed millions of jobs through faulty policies like demonetisation. 150 million people were lifted out of poverty in the last decade. But millions have been pushed to poverty now.

This decline has occurred at a time when the domestic and global situations are favourable to the BJP. Firstly, they have an absolute majority in the LS and have governments in more than half of the Indian states. Secondly, the global economy is doing well. Thirdly, global crude oil prices were at a record low in the last four years. Fourthly, Modi and his party have received huge moral, political, and financial support from the people of India and the NRIs in these four years.

Despite all these favourable conditions, which no PM has enjoyed after Rajiv Gandhi, Modi failed to exploit this wonderful opportunity and harmed the economy through his policies, for which he deserves nothing but criticism and a vote out in 2019. The PMs in the last thirty years, significantly, PV Narasimha Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh, who headed coalition governments and faced global economic crises with fluctuating crude prices, will be remembered as the best performers of rapid economic development. And Modi will be remembered as the best performer of drama and theatrics.
