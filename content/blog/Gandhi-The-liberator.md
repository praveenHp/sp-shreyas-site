+++

Many great personalities contributed to reversing the declining morale of the Indian civilisation in the last two centuries. But it was Gandhi who was able to mobilise the people of India from every nook and corner of the country socially, politically, and spiritually to infuse the forgotten values of the Indian tradition and decolonise the country.

Gandhi's leadership turned the independence movement into the greatest mass movement in world history. He infused the values of honesty, truth, and non-violence in the movement to undo the rotten values that were engulfing Indian civilisation.

Gandhi was instrumental in liberating the country from colonialism. But his significance is unparalleled in awakening the spirit of the Indian people en masse, from peasants to industrialists. Belittling Gandhi is not just being bitter but it is being ungrateful to a person who triggered a
civilizational churn of which we all are the beneficiaries.
