Impact of demonetisation!

1. Entire country pushed into chaos overnight by an unprepared government.
2. Cashless ATMs.
3. Entire country forced into banks to deposit demonetised notes.
4. 105 people die standing in long queues.
5. Millions of jobs destroyed.
6. Manufacturing industry devastated.
7. Big jolt to the economy which was in an upswing.
8. GDP declines by 2%.
9. 99.3% of demonetised notes returns to banks.
10. Black money gets sanctified through banks.
11. Only instance in the world where the government facilitated conversion of black money into white.
12. Zero impact on targeted issues like corruption, fake notes, Kashmiri militancy, black money and its usage in elections.
13. Usage of hard cash returns to the same level as during pre-DeMo days.
14. Total hard currency in the system increases than pre-DeMo days.

All these occurred due to one man's megalomaniac instincts, who ignored the advice of economists and sabotaged RBI's autonomy to implement his hare-brained idea, that cost the nation dearly. In any other democratic country, such a leader would be unseated immediately and penalised for causing such unprecedented, unwanted damage.
