The outrage against Ranveer Allahbadia’s obscene comments in ‘India’s Got Talent’ show is justifiable. He is an influencer with millions of followers. His comments can have repercussions on young minds.

But what is appalling is the way the political community is reacting to it. They are deeply entrenched in hate and obscene speeches. The rhetoric in political space has fallen to its lowest in the last ten years. They don’t have any moral right to preach sermons.

In Ranveer’s case, I think he should be warned to be mindful of his comments. And ‘India’s Got Talent’ show should be aware of the consequences of their show on society. However, I don’t think they have violated free speech despite being crass in their comments.

Free speech should be allowed as far as the speech doesn’t lead to social disharmony and violence. Such indecent, gross comments only need moral indignation so that such influencers would make the necessary course correction.
