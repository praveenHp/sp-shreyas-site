title = 'Lenin statue razed in Tripura'

No matter how controversial the Communist revolutionary Lenin is, the pulling down of his statue by BJP thugs on the wake of the Communist defeat in Tripura elections is a dangerous precedent set by the BJP.

The independent struggle of India was dominated by two rival political ideologies represented by two different political organisations, namely the Congress and the Communist Party of India. Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel were the sympathisers of Congress' ideas, while Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose were the sympathisers of the Communist ideology. The two different think tanks never tried to destroy each other but respected each other and exchanged ideas between them.

Despite the domination of Congress, which was ideologically neutral, and the Communist Party of India, which was leftist in ideology, the Indian Republic was constitutionally recognised as a multi-party democracy, which means that the ideologies ranging from far-left to far-right had an opportunity to thrive. This is the reason why right-wing ideological parties like the BJP, Shiv Sena, AIMIM, etc., which were non-existent and had no role to play in the country's independence, do exist today and are ruling the nation.

The BJP, which rules this country because of the multi-party democracy established by our founding fathers, is itself disrespecting and destroying the multi-party setup. What an irony!!
