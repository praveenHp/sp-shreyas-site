Finished reading Jawaharlal Nehru's 'Glimpses of World History' book. What an intellectual odyssey of world history! Though this book was written from prison in the form of letters to his teenage daughter Indira nearly a century ago, the book seems to be relevant even today.

Nehru articulates world history briefly, precisely, and understandably in a layman’s language. He covers world events of a 5000-year span from almost 3000 BCE till the beginning of the Second World War. 

Nehru had great exposure to Indian and Western culture. In this book, Nehru writes as an Indian without showing any partisanship towards Indian culture or prejudice towards foreign culture. He evaluates history rationally and convincingly. 

His viewpoint about the events occurring during his time and his predictions and fears about the future have turned out to happen exactly the same way as he foresaw it, except for a few. Anyone who wants a rational, non-partisan, and intellectual understanding of world history should definitely read this book.
