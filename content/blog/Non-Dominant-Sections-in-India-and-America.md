title = 'Non-Dominant Sections in India and America' 
+++

The political representation of non-dominant sections in a diverse society indicates the fairness of a democracy. The American diversity is dominated by race and ethnicity, while the Indian diversity is dominated by religion and languages. Most of the time, linguistic identity becomes synonymous with ethnicity in India. 

The Indian diversity is a product of invasions and migrations since 3000 years. The internal social revolts against the existing social order also led to the birth of new philosophies, cultures, and religions within India. However, there has been no significant addition to the diversity of India since the advent of British rule.

The American diversity is a product of invasions and migrations since 500 years. Their diversity remains continuous with the significant addition of people from different origins till today.

In India, the non-dominant sections in top positions are mainly women, religious minorities, and Dalits. Nevertheless, there have been many firsts in India with respect to the representation of non-dominant sections in top legislative, executive, and party positions. It was mostly spearheaded by the Congress.

1. First non-Indian head of a political party of India - George Yule in 1888

2. First woman head of a political party of India - Annie Besant in 1917

3. First woman CM - Sucheta Kripalani in 1963

4. First woman PM - Indira Gandhi in 1966

5. First Vice-President and President from a minority community - Zakir Hussain in 1962 and 1967, respectively

6. First Sikh President - Zail Singh in 1982

7. First Dalit Vice-President and President - KR Narayanan in 1992 and 1997 respectively

8. First PM from South India - PV Narasimha Rao in 1992

9. First Dalit Speaker of Lok Sabha - GMC Balayogi in 1998

10. First naturalized citizen to head a major political party of India and a ruling coalition - Sonia Gandhi in 1998 and 2004

12. First PM from a minority community - Dr Manmohan Singh in 2004

13. First woman President - Prathibha Patil in 2007

14. First woman Speaker of Lok Sabha - Meira Kumar in 2009

However, there is no continuity in representation of non-dominant sections in India unlike America. Most of the top positions have only got their firsts. 

There should be equal opportunity and a fair competition available to everyone to thrive without any hindrance to growth based on their gender, religion or caste. That would be a truly representative democracy.
