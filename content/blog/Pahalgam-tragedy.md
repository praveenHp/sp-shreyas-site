Pakistan orchestrated a clever strategy in Pahalgam, attempting to ignite communal tensions in an already deeply divided country. Five years after the abrogation of Article 370, elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir.

Kashmir, heavily reliant on tourism, began functioning under a democratic government. However, Pakistan orchestrated a terror attack targeting only non-Muslims, aiming to trigger communal tensions in India and cripple tourism in Kashmir. Social media platforms in India were flooded with anti-Muslim posts. Thankfully, this did not escalate into widespread violence across the country.

Regardless of religious affiliation, whether Hindu or Muslim, religion can be a powerful tool to evoke emotions and create division and instability in society for the nefarious purposes of vested interests.
