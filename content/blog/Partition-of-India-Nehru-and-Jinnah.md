It is unfair to put the onus on Nehru for Jinnah's arrogance. Nehru reluctantly agreed to give up his ambition when Gandhi proposed Jinnah's name for PM to keep the country united. But Jinnah refused.

Jinnah was very ambitious and wanted to play a major role in the Indian independence movement. He had no prejudice for non-Muslims. But he felt inferior in front of Gandhi and Nehru. Gandhi's mass appeal and Nehru's intellect overshadowed Jinnah. Gandhi's invocation of Hindu culture in politics, though in an inclusive way, gave fodder for Jinnah to believe that India will be driven by Hindu values after independence. He propounded that Muslims would be unsafe in undivided India. Also, Jinnah's inability to match the might of Gandhi and Nehru made him realise that he can be a supreme leader only in the Muslim state.

Jinnah never made an attempt to come out of his bitterness to become the major force of the independence movement. He was never sent to jail as he was apologetic towards the British Indian government. On the other hand, Nehru spent ten years in jail fighting the British rule. Nehru did sacrifice a lot personally and professionally for the movement. Nehru undoubtedly had political and moral authority to head the first government of independent India.

When Jinnah was overshadowed by Gandhi's mass appeal and Nehru's charisma, he responded bitterly to them instead of accepting them for what they are! Instead of playing smart in politics, he played bitter, to the extent of dividing the country.

Jinnah was deeply concerned about the plight of Muslims in undivided India. Despite being offered the prime ministership of India, which he didn't deserve due to his limited impact on the independence movement, he declined the offer. He knew that his Muslim League party would be defeated by the Congress party in the first elections.
