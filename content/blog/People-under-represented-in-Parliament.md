In a parliamentary democracy like India where the lower house of the Parliament (Lok Sabha) elects
the government, the number of people represented by a Lok Sabha MP is important. In India, each
Lok Sabha MP represents an average of 22.68 lakh people. In other successful parliamentary
democracies of the world, each MP represents around 1 lakh people. UK has 650 MPs to represent
a population of 6.37cr while India has 545 MPs to represent 123cr population (2011 census). Also,
representation differs from each state/UT largely. A Rajasthan MP represents 27.45 lakh people, a
Goa MP represents 7.3 lakh people and a Lakshadweep MP represents 64,000 people.

For efficient governance, I think it is essential that each MP should represent not more than 10 lakh
people. Some regions of the country where family planning was successful, we can have an MP
representing not less than 5 lakh people. If we delimit the constituencies of India per 10 lakh people
based on current population of 135cr (2018 projection), the number of seats in Lok Sabha will go up
to 1350 from the current 545. If a country like Germany can have 709 MPs for 8.1cr people, I think a
huge democracy like India should have at least 1350 to 1500 MPs in Lok Sabha to increase
representation and improve governance.
