India has turned into a morally bankrupt society. The 20th century saw political, intellectual, and spiritual revolution in India. It was the century of great figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and Rabindranath Tagore. These men fought against the declining morality and rotting values of Indian society. They shook the conscience of the masses into the right path. Non-violence, spirituality, holding onto truth, mutual respect, unity in diversity, critical thinking, and scientific temper were some of the values that gained importance in the century. 

A social revolution occurs when a society sheds the values that inhibit its intellectual and spiritual development. The Age of Enlightenment during the 17th century brought European society out of its deeply rooted dogma and minimized the role of the Church in society and governance. It paved the way for the intellectual and philosophical revolution that modernised Europe to an unprecedented extent. The scientific and industrial revolution that shaped the modern world was led by Europe.

Today's India is witnessing a steady decline in the moral and ethical values of our civilization. 'Ram Rajya' in the 20th century meant good governance, social justice, mutual love, and ethical behaviour. 'Ram Rajya' in today's context means fear, hatred, and aggression. While Gandhi, Vivekananda, and Tagore had the ability to bring out the best values in people, Modi and his coterie have succeeded in bringing out the worst values in people. Such a decline in values is antithetical to the progress of society. I hope this decline is just temporary.
