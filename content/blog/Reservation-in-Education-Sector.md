title = 'Reservation in Education Sector'

Reservation policy is an affirmative action for the upliftment of historically disadvantaged castes and tribes. The reservation of seats in the education sector is provided on the basis of caste, tribe, religion (under backward classes), economic status, gender, physical disability, and occupation of parents. The major beneficiaries of reservation are backward castes and tribes.

Reservation is governed by constitutional laws, statutory laws, and local rules and regulations. When Dr. Ambedkar demanded a separate electorate for depressed classes, Mahatma Gandhi convinced Ambedkar to give up the demand. In the Poona Pact of 1932, both came to an agreement to reserve electoral seats for depressed classes in the legislature of the British Indian government. The Constitution of India abolished untouchability under Article 17. Article 15(4) and 16(4) provide special provisions and reservations for socially and educationally backward classes and SC/STs. 

Dalits are former untouchables who are categorised as Scheduled Castes (SC) and Adivasis are the tribal population who are categorised as Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the Constitution of India. The reservation policy was extended to backward sections of society other than SC/ST under Other Backward Classes (OBCs) based on the Mandal Commission report, which was implemented in 1992. The 'class' mentioned here must be seen in the context of 'caste' according to the Indra Sawhney case judgment.

Due to the historical disadvantage experienced by these castes and tribes, it is essential to provide reservation in education. Education is a means to uplift people. As the upper sections of society are socially and educationally empowered, the lower sections lose the competition in education and employment opportunities. Also, the unawareness of the importance of education among the majority of lower sections is worrying. The low economic status discourages them from pursuing education. In the context of India, the caste is highly synonymous with economic status due to several historic reasons.

The reservation in education upholds the principle of social justice propounded by our Constitution. The societal inequality has led SCs, STs and OBCs to be grossly under represented in society. The inadequate representation is filled through proportional representation of under represented sections of society.

However, there is a resentment among general candidates against reservation as the benefits of reservation are enjoyed by some beneficiaries for several generations. Also prioritisation of representation over merit in education sector is criticised. The purpose of reservation is to uplift the historically disadvantaged groups. Once a family or a group enjoys the benefits of reservation, the family is empowered educationally and hence they have to make way for others who are yet to be uplifted is the argument. This is the principle of social justice.

True. The reservation policy has to be reformed. The beneficiaries of reservation for generations must make way for the people who haven't yet benefited from it. The concept of creamy layer is a good thought. The reservation must be extended to some sections like transgenders who are also historically disadvantaged. The 33% reservation for women is not yet approved by Parliament though it has been implemented in some states. 

Reservation policy was aimed at historically disadvantaged groups. But the policy has become a politically polarising issue and has led to violent protests for and against the policy. The affluent communities are claiming to be backward to avail the benefits of policy. Hence the genuine reforms in the policy by considering the socio-economic and educational conditions of all the sections of society is necessary.
