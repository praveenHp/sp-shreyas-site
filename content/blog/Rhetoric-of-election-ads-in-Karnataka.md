title = 'Rhetoric of election ads in Karnataka'
+++

The Congress's newspaper ad against BJP focused on inflation, devolution of taxes, and Modi governmentâ€™s indifference towards Karnataka.

The BJP's newspaper ad against Congress focused on Muslims, Naxals, cow slaughter, and Cauvery water. 7 out of 9 points mentioned in the ad were directly or indirectly related to Muslims. There was nothing related to development and people's welfare.

It is no surprise that the entire ecosystem of the BJP exists on the plank of Muslims and fear-mongering. Hypothetically speaking, if Muslims stopped existing from tomorrow, the BJP would crumble and die down in a short span of time. 

In Karnataka, the crime committed by a Muslim boy against a Hindu girl is being twisted to give a communal colour. Despite the boy's arrest and ordering of a CID enquiry, the BJP is protesting across Karnataka for no legitimate reason.

The Prime Minister, in an election rally, manipulated Dr. Manmohan Singh's statement on distribution of resources. Modi blatantly violated the model code of conduct by making derogatory comments against Muslims.  It proves the BJP has nothing visionary for India. They are just focused on invoking religion and gaining control of the state. 

The birth of the BJP, its very existence, and the way of winning elections are all based on triggering emotions of people. This is because the BJP doesn't have a foundation of Indian philosophical values of truth, honesty, sacrifice, and non-violence.
