Born into Western culture, she made India her home and embraced Indian culture.

Tragically, she lost three close family members—Sanjay, Indira, and Rajiv—including her husband, in a span of a decade due to accidents and assassinations. This devastating loss left her deeply affected.

When Congress was leaderless, she entered politics and faced a tough challenge from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had emerged as a new force in Indian politics after the Babri Masjid demolition. Despite constant abuses and criticism from the BJP for her foreign origin, she remained steadfast and defeated the Vajpayee government, bringing Congress back to power.

Despite being a naturalised citizen and a leader responsible for her party’s victory, she denied the post of Prime Minister and continued to work tirelessly for the welfare of the people.

Truly, she is a remarkable woman in Indian politics!
