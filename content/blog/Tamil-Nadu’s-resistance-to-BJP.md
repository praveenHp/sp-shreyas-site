title = "Tamil Naduâ€™s resistance to BJP"
+++

Out of all the states in India, Tamil Nadu is a unique and interesting state. The state is an epitome of Hindu culture with i) a rich Hindu heritage, ii) the most ancient and historic Hindu temples, iii) one of the oldest languages of India, and iv) a history of mighty Hindu rulers like Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas.

Yet it remains the only state which has kept BJP and its predecessors out of the state almost in every election since independence. The state has given a message to the country in every election that BJP/ Sangh is not a representative of Hindus. TN has displayed maturity by understanding the evil intentions of the BJP to use religion only to gain power.
Kudos!
