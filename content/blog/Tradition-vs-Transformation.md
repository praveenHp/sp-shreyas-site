Vedas, Gita, Bible, Quran, Guru Granth Sahib, Zend Avesta etc. do preach moral values and gives us essential inputs when we are in need of it. Also they contain age old concepts crumbling humanity like casteism, superstitions, male chauvinism, misogyny, homophobia, intolerance to differences, incitement to violence, just to name a few.
 
The solution to this would be allowing open debate and discussion on scriptures and understanding its relevance and irrelevance in the present world. Being too proud and blind about one's own religion and its philosophy, getting touchy to the constructive criticism without rational evaluation of it is the source of religious fundamentalism in this world. The day when religions become open to criticism is the day when fundamentalism starts to end. Such renaissance would pave the way for the evolution of humanity.
