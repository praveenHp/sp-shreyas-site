SC striking down draconian instant triple talaq (Talaq-ul-bidat) is the first step in the fight against patriarchal marriage laws. Next fight should be against Talaq-Ahsan and Talaq-Hasan which are again patriarchal in nature where the husband gets the sole right to pronounce talaq and a woman is supposed to observe iddat for 3 months after which the marriage dissolves if the husband doesn't revoke the talaq. Any marriage that gives husband the sole right over dissolution and revocation of marriage is discriminative and misogynistic.

Historically, Islam and Hinduism have been highly discriminative against women. However, Hindu personal laws underwent reforms and came under the ambit of Indian Constitution in mid 1950s with the passage of Hindu code bills. This law played a major role in the progress of Hindu community. It is high time that Muslim personal laws are brought under the ambit of Constitution.
