America has rejected a second term to a blatant liar, fascist, and demagogue who was crippling the nation and the world. It seems that people have sensed the blunders of the Trump presidency. 

India failed to deny a second term to Modi, who has more dangerous qualities than Trump. Despite that, Modi was able to win a second term with a higher majority. 

This is because of spineless media and compromised institutions. The American media stood up to Trump since the beginning of his presidency. The institutions were resilient against Trump's excesses. 

In India, Modi's pathological lying, blatant use of religion, exploitation of prejudices between communities, and promotion of minority hatred in a largely conservative society remained unchecked by the media and institutions. Instead, the opposition parties were targeted. 

The cost of Modi's second term is the unscientific handling of the COVID crisis and the highest dip in GDP growth among major economies of the world. The Kashmir crisis and Chinese settlements inside Indian borders have escalated the security threat to India. Aggressive Hindutva is tearing apart the social fabric of India. 

By involving himself in American politics through the endorsement of Trump for a second term and not congratulating Kamala Harris for her Vice-Presidential candidacy, Modi has committed another blunder. 

Americans have saved their democracy this year. Let's save ours in 2024.
