This country will never progress until we find enemies within ourselves. People can be manipulated to hate anyone based on language, religion, or race.

If a guy posts something against Kannada actors, he is assaulted by a group of intolerant goons without understanding how that common boy's post can affect Kannada actors/industry. Adding fuel to that, Kannada media presents this news without condemning that group's hooliganism against the helpless boy, and Tamil media instigates people by saying entire Tamilians are unsafe in Bangalore, resulting in attacks on Kannadigas in Tamil Nadu. Again, Kannada media plays its deceptive role to instigate people, giving rise to violent outbursts in Bangalore, bringing the entire city to a standstill.

This is nothing but madness. We are finding opportunities to make enemies within ourselves. We don't lose any opportunity to start hating someone. If a water-sharing issue between a few districts of Karnataka and TN can turn into an invocation of Kannada and Tamil sentiments, look at how people can be manipulated. 

And people out there, whether Kannadigas or Tamilians, who are claiming that we are great and big-hearted, must realise that no community as a whole is sacrosanct. There are good and bad people, broad-minded and narrow-minded people, cunning and big-hearted people across both communities. No community has inherited all good qualities as a whole.
