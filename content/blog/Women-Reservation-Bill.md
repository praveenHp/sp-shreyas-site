title = ‘Women’s Reservation Bill’ 
+++

Throughout history, women have fought tirelessly to claim their space in politics, from fighting for the right to vote to heading governments.

In the aftermath of the two world wars in the 20th century, women’s role in politics underwent a significant shift. Charismatic women like Indira Gandhi (India), Golda Meir (Israel), Margaret Thatcher (UK), and Benazir Bhutto (Pakistan) headed democratically elected governments.

Despite having a woman Prime Minister and many women Chief Ministers, women’s representation in state assemblies and parliament in India has been meagre. Although comprising nearly 50% of the population, their representation in the 2019 Lok Sabha is just 14.4%, and less than 10% in many state assemblies.

When society is reluctant to give any section of people its due, laws should be enacted to bring those sections to the mainstream.

The Women’s Reservation Bill, which provides 33% reservation to women in legislatures, is historic in this regard. However, the government’s intention to implement it in 2029 delays the long-pending reform by another five to six years.

Various researches have shown that increased participation of women in politics is correlated to reduced crime rates, corruption, violence, and increased social justice. I hope this reform will lead to more women leaders, Chief Ministers, and Prime Ministers, ultimately resulting in a better society.
