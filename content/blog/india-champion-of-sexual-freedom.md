India is neither liberal nor regressive when it comes to LGBT issues. Religion, lack of knowledge
on homosexuality, and misconceptions spread by homophobic religious and political leaders are
some of the stumbling blocks to LGBT rights. While the Bible and Qur'an are clearly homophobic,
most of the Hindu scriptures speak positively about homosexuality. In recent centuries, Hindu
religious leaders and Hindutva politicians have also turned homophobic, thus making LGBT rights
a difficult task in religiously blind India.

To achieve LGBT rights, we must create awareness among people, clear up misconceptions, and
give proper knowledge about homosexuality and LGBT rights. The interference of religion must
be reduced as much as possible. We must stop hesitating to speak out openly about such issues
irrespective of sexual orientation. LGBT issues must be made a political issue. In the current
political system, the Congress and AAP are open to taking up this issue. It is progressive-minded
people who must make this issue politically important to achieve one of the important human
rights in India.

Albert Einstein's quote, "The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who
are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it," inspires us to fight for human
rights.
