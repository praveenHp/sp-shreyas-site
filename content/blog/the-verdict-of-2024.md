What a fantastic show by the INDIA alliance! With a loss of around 65 seats, Modi has been snubbed by voters. The voting pattern clearly shows that the Indian people wanted a new regime at the Centre. The opposition alliance, INDIA led by Congress, has lost the majority just by about 35 seats.

The general elections of 2024 were one of the most challenging elections for the opposition in post-independent history. Despite a) the compromised Election Commission, b) the misuse of ED & CBI, c) the sold-out media, d) fake news on social media, e) businessmen funding the BJP hugely, f) blatant hate speeches by Modi and his coterie, g) pathological lies spread by PM himself, and h) the paid opinion polls & exit polls in favour of the ruling party, the INDIA alliance did manage to bring the NDA down.

Modi has lost the moral authority to become PM again. If he continues to be PM, he will go down as the desperate, power-hungry politician who failed to sense people's message. 

With today's results, it should be understood that nothing is permanent. No one is a messiah. Everything keeps changing. People can't be taken for granted forever!
