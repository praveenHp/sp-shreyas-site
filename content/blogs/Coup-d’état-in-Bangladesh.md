The crisis in Bangladesh is sad and concerning. After its liberation from Pakistan, Bangladesh contrasted Pakistan in democratic values, secular principles, and good economic growth. The Awami League, which secured the country's independence in 1971, imbibed these values under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his daughter Sheikh Hasina.

However, any political party should not take people for granted. The Hasina government failed to address the rising unemployment. The economic growth didn’t trickle down to the common people through welfare schemes. Though elections were conducted regularly, the election process was unfair and manipulative. 

The prolonged tenure of Sheikh Hasina also increased anti-incumbency to a great extent. The opposition parties, the Islamists, and the Army sensed the growing unpopularity and discontent against the Hasina government. The opportunity was efficiently used by them and the deep state to bring her down.

Had she allowed people to vent out their frustration in free and fair elections, I think the country wouldn’t have faced such a crisis. The country which took birth due to the efforts and sacrifices of Sheikh Hasina’s family and her party Awami League should not forget the past. Despite her shortcomings, Hasina doesn’t deserve this treatment by her people.
