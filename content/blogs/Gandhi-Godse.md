Today is the 75th death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The manner of Gandhi's death was one of
the most tragic events in world history.

In today's India, it is not objectionable to legitimise or decriminalise Gandhi's assassin. The fact of
the matter is that Gandhi's killer registered his name in history books only because he shot Gandhi.
Otherwise, his name would not be present even in the dustbin of history as his contribution to India
or to the anti-British movement was nil.

Gandhi's advocacy of absolute truth, peace, and non-violence may have irritated or may still irritate
some countrymen. But we should not forget that Gandhi was the only person who could mobilise
the entire country through his idea of satyagraha. He led the greatest mass movement in world
history, which proves that people accepted his ways and teachings.

To give legitimacy to any person who inflicts physical or mental harm on someone is inhumane. And
attempts to decriminalise Gandhi's assassin in
people's psyche are sad and unfortunate.
