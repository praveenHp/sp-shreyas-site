title = 'Gandhi and the Truth'
+++

Truth is the fundamental element of Indian philosophy. Most of the major religions of the world stress the importance of truth.
The leader who showed truth can be used as a foundation in politics was Mahatma Gandhi. He believed truth is the supreme force and said, 'Truth is God. He even placed truth above nonviolence.â€™

During his struggle for freedom, nowhere did he compromise with or sacrifice truth to achieve freedom. The political space is often considered a crooked space. Gandhi's absolute determination to truth in such a space is a rarity in world history. This has inspired generations of leaders across the world.
