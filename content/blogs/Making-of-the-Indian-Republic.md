Ninety years ago, the Indian National Congress, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, declared 'Purna Swaraj' in the Lahore Session. The gradual transfer of power proposed by the British government was rejected, and the complete withdrawal of British rule was demanded. This event marked a major shift in the Indian independence movement. 26th January, 1930, was observed as the first Independence Day.

Twenty years later, the resolve of the Indian independence movement came into fruition with the enforcement of the Indian Constitution for governing India. The Constitution of India is not just a document of laws. It represents the struggle, dedication, hard work, aspirations, passion, and sacrifice of countless people who shaped the idea of Indian nationalism. The sense of nationalism, which is usually absent in multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic, and multi-religious societies, was infused by the freedom struggle in India. The freedom struggle gave a fillip to Indian civilization, which had been struck by stagnation for thousand years. 

Most of the major successful countries in the world have had some event in their history that brought them out of their labyrinth. The American Revolution from 1765 to 1783, the French Revolution of 1789, the Industrial Revolution in Britain from the 18th century, the Unification of Italy in 1848, the Unification of Germany in 1871, the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Chinese Revolution of 1949, and the anti-apartheid movement of South Africa were some events that changed the destinies of these countries. The mass movement for Indian independence was one such event which brought Indians out of prolonged hibernation and pushed them into action.

The countries that took birth as a result of artificial borders created by foreign powers without any social or political movements emerging from inside are still struggling to find their voice. The best example is the Arab countries of West Asia that are struggling to find their voice despite having wealth and resources.

The Constitution of India with its secular, non-discriminatory, and judicious nature is a testimony to the awakening of the Indian conscience since the twentieth century. It is the most important document to preserve the spirit of India.  

Happy Republic Day! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
