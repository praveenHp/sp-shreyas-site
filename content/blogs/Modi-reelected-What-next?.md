title = 'Modi reelected - What next?'
+++

A country gets the government it deserves. The country which elected Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi with an outright majority for three terms each has now reelected Narendra Modi for a second term with a huge majority. 

Political differences apart, the next five years of Modi are a reality. The nation has bestowed its destiny in the hands of the BJP for another term. The future of millions of youth will be dependent on the policies made by this government. India is currently suffering from a stagnating economy, banking frauds, an unemployment crisis, and agricultural distress. 

Modi wouldn't have the same comfort as in his first term if he doesn't address these issues effectively. To address any issue effectively, he should be consultative and should respect the talent of this country to bring real solutions. If he succeeds, he will be appreciated as a reformer. If he doesn't, he will face the wrath of the people for staking the future of this country. I hope he succeeds and I wish the new government all the best.
