Human beings naturally develop bitterness from prolonged exploitation and oppression. They harbour hatred and try to avenge the oppressor, but soon realise that hatred consumes them before the oppressor.

In India, a similar crisis arose during British rule. Centuries of exploitative rule left the country impoverished. There was significant resentment against the British. However, Mahatma Gandhi didn't use hatred and violence to combat them. He believed the British should leave India and self governance should end exploitation. However, this should happen without Indians engaging in self-destruction physically, morally, or spiritually. This is why he introduced truth and nonviolence as weapons against the British and a spiritual lesson for Indians.

The greatness of an individual lies not in avenging the oppressor but in forgiving them and fighting for one's cause peacefully. This doesn't harm the individual or the oppressor. This was the contribution of Gandhi to the world.

Ethical concepts have been used to fight for causes before Gandhi, but he was the first leader to use them on a large scale to mobilise millions and achieve results. His influence extended to many global movements. The American Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. brought revolutionary changes to Black lives. The Anti-Apartheid Movement led by Nelson Mandela liberated South Africa from racist rule. The pro-democratic Movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar established a democratic government.
Numerous environmental movements, farmers' protests, and peaceful anti-government protests worldwide are influenced by Gandhi's ideas.

Gandhi offered a practical guide to the world, showing how to fight for a cause and achieve tangible results without causing harm to oneself or others.
