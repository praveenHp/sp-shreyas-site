Rakshasa Tangadi, a play by Girish Karnad, narrates the events of the Battle of Talikota, a pivotal conflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and a coalition of four Deccan Sultans that ultimately led to the downfall of the Vijayanagara Empire.

The play vividly portrays how the mighty and prosperous Vijayanagara Empire, despite possessing superior horses, elephants, and soldiers, succumbed to defeat. The fragmented sultans of Deccan united to form an alliance, aiming to dismantle Rama Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire.

Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, finds himself in a profound dilemma during the war. Initially, he regarded Rama Raya as his father due to Raya’s assistance during a crisis. However, the Sultan of Ahmednagar forged a marital alliance with Adil Shah, bringing him under the umbrella of the Sultanate alliance.

As the war commenced, Adil Shah grappled with a significant dilemma: whether to abstain from the conflict or fight for the Deccan Sultanate. The intricacies of this crisis are masterfully depicted in the play. 

The sultans attempted to instigate Shah by reminding him of the insults he had endured from certain princes and ministers of the Vijayanagara Empire. Ultimately, they succeeded in persuading Shah to send his army against Rama Raya. Despite this, Adil Shah chose to personally abstain from fighting the war.

The Vijayanagara Empire’s defeat can be attributed to several factors: the alliance formed by the four Deccan Sultans, the superior artillery employed by the Deccan Sultans, Rama Raya’s arrogance and self-centeredness, and Adil Shah’s inclination towards the sultans.

Girish Karnad’s play intricately explores the emotions and nuances surrounding this historical event, providing a profound insight into the complexities of power, loyalty, and the consequences of alliances.
