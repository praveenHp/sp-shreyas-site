title = 'Rapes in India'
+++

Human beings are inherently barbaric in nature. Society disciplines them and  imbibes civility in them. The nature of society depends upon how people treat and respect fellow citizens and their free thoughts. A society where conservatism and fundamentalism get patronage, a society where you are taught to hate people based on their colour, culture, gender, ideology, etc., is bound to suffer dire consequences like riots, robbery, murders, rapes, discrimination, etc. 

In Kathua and Unnao rape incidents, it is the political and religious patronage that has emboldened them to do this heinous crime. In India, the majority of rape victims are Dalit women because the society hasn't evolved from the discriminatory caste system. It is the duty of each and every one to create a healthy society devoid of prejudice against women, sexual minorities, and fellow citizens.
