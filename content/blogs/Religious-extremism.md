When you condemn Hindutva terror, you are tagged as an 'anti-Hindu' and you will be asked to look at terrorism of other religions.

When you condemn Islamic terrorism, you are tagged as an 'Islamophobe' and you will be asked to look at the atrocities committed by West.

When you condemn Sikh terrorism, you are tagged as an 'anti-Sikh' and you will be asked to remember injustice to Sikhs during partition.

When you condemn Jewish religious terrorism, you are tagged as an 'antisemite' and you will be asked to recall the history.

No fundamentalists would concede that their religion has radical elements. And the worrying part is the silence of the followers of the respective religion who fail to acknowledge that religion is giving rise to extremism.
