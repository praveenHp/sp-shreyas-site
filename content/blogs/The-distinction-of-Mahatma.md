In the darkest century of human history, when the world witnessed unimaginable violence, a man emerged as a beacon of hope. He fought his country’s oppressors through the power of nonviolence.

When the 5,000-year-old Indian civilisation was beset by rotten values, a broken spirit, and exploitative colonial rule, Gandhi infused the values of truth, honesty, and righteousness into the masses through satyagraha.

While the struggle for freedom began in the late 1800s, limited to the elitist and educated, Gandhi’s entry into the freedom movement in 1917 mobilised every section of society, from peasants to industrialists. This gave rise to the greatest mass movement in world history.

As the industrial countries of Europe and North America, in their pursuit of global dominance, indulged in world wars, resulting in the deaths of nearly 100 million people, Gandhi advocated for the path of passive resistance, non-cooperation, and civil disobedience to liberate his country.

When Hitler, driven by racial hatred, exterminated 5 million innocent Jews, Gandhi stood firm against the foreign race that had oppressed his country for three centuries, devoid of hatred or bitterness.

As the country spiralled into worsening communal violence after partition, Gandhi sacrificed his life in his relentless pursuit of communal harmony. His death sent shockwaves through the masses, leading to an immediate halt in the violence.
