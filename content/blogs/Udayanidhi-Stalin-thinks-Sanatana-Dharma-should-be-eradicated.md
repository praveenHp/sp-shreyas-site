It’s impossible to eradicate any culture or religion from society. Cultures have their own time periods and thrive and decline organically based on their ability to keep people under their control. It’s nonsensical and provocative to wish for or attempt the eradication of a culture.

The communist (leftist) philosophy views religion as a social ill and the opium of the masses. Conservative (rightist) parties like the BJP and AIMIM advocate fundamentalism and are averse to religious reforms. Centrist parties like Congress and AAP don’t bother much about religion but are in favour of religious reforms.

It’s true that the fluid Varna system of the Vedic period deteriorated into a repressive caste system and untouchability, which is one of the debilitating features of Indian civilisation. However, the solution to this is not the eradication or annihilation of any culture or group because it’s not pragmatic. Even communist countries like China and Russia couldn’t achieve a non-religious society.

The solution is to address the issues that bother a caste, community, or group. Instead of futile talks about eradicating the caste system, I think we should empower each caste or community based on their social and economic status. The Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) can be used in this regard, and affirmative action should be provided based on this.

Promotion of intercaste, interfaith, interracial, and gender-neutral marriages also dilutes the caste system and gives rise to a hybrid culture. Gandhi was a strong advocate of intercaste marriages.

Any element of religion that doesn’t align with modern society has to be addressed through laws and reforms. These can help us deal with social ills, discriminatory practices, superstitious beliefs, and inequality caused by culture, caste, and religion.
