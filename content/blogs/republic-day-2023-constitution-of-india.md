As of 2023, the Constitution of India governs about one-sixth of humanity (1.4 bn), equivalent to
the population of three continents (Europe, North America, Australia) plus two countries (Brazil,
South Africa).

The average survival period of a national constitution in the world is seventeen years. Only 19%
of constitutions have lasted till fiftieth year.

The Constitution of India has continued unbroken and unhindered for 73 years. With its capacity
to remain considerably flexible through constitutional amendments, it has adapted to the
changing societal needs and aspirations without compromising on the basic fundamentals and
the idea of India, thus proving to be a living document. This accomplishment is largely
attributable to the will of the people and the Constituent Assembly that framed the Constitution.

After Partition, the Constituent Assembly of India had 299 members belonging to different caste,
region, religion and gender. It consisted of towering leaders such as Nehru, Ambedkar and Patel.
Though Gandhiji was not a part of it, his moral and spiritual framework had a great influence over
the Assembly.

The members of the Assembly had decades of exposure to the Indian masses through freedom
struggle. They were well versed in the nitty-gritty of governance due to prolonged dialogue,
negotiations and conflict with the British Indian government.

All these factors have made Indian Constitution a long-lasting document. Any attempt to trample
upon this document by the ruling establishment would only undo the progress we have made so
far.
